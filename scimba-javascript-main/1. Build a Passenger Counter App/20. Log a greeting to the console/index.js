// Create two variables, name and greeting. The name variable should store your name,
name1 = "Manish";
// and the greeting should store e.g. "Hi, my name is "
greeting = "Hi my name is ";

// Create a third variable, myGreeting, that contatenates the two strings
myGreeting = greeting + name1;
// Log myGreeting to the console
console.log(myGreeting);
